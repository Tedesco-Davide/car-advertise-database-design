-- Introduction

Mike wants to start his own Car Advertise Website and would like to be helped with the data storage processes,
with the design and implementation of a proper tailormade database.

-- Client requests

The client forsees only cars and users.

Cars data required
	- Model
	- Year
	- Brand
	- Body
	- Description
	- Pictures

Users data required
	- Name and Surname
	- Email
	- Username

The first step would be spec out all of the fields for the data we want to collect.
Then I will be adding related tables and defining the table relationships.
This process will be reducing redundancy and improve efficiency.
